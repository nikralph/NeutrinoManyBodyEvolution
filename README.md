# NeutrinoManyBodyEvolution
Generalized code for a neutrino many-body system evolution using the full neutrino-neutrino interaction term, Hvv(F), in the Hamiltonian, instead of the truncated Hvv(T) term. Please see [_Neutrinon many-body flavor evolution: the full Hamiltonian_](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16690) for more information.

Thank you, Vincenzo Cirigliano and Yukari Yamauchi!<br/><br/>

The codebase uses a lot of the code from https://github.com/yukariyamauchi/neutrinos_beyond_fwd/.<br/><br/>
